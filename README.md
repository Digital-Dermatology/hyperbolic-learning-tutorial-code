# Hyperbolic learning tutorial code

Code for the tutorial "Hyperbolic Learning in Action" at AMLD 2025.

## Usage

### Environment

To facilitate environment setup,
it is strongly recommeded to run the tutorial on Google Colab or Kaggle.
If you wish to execute the code locally, you are welcome to do so,
but it will be impossible us to provide individual support.

### Requirements

The HypLL library used in this tutorial requires `python>=3.10`.
Lower `python` versions may seem to work at first,
but could lead to unexpected errors with fully hyperbolic networks.

### Instructions

1. Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Digital-Dermatology/hyperbolic-learning-tutorial-code.git
```
1. Install requirements in `requirements.txt`.
1. Install `jupyter-lab` if needed.
1. Open the notebook `hyplia.ipynb` from the `notebooks` folder.
1. Enjoy.
